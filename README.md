## Overview

Many organizations struggle with tracking AI initiatives and communicating their progress internally. The AI Adoption Assistant solves three specific problems:

1. **Traceability** — A centralized dashboard to track AI projects, their status, owners, and milestones
2. **Communication** — An AI-powered newsletter generator that turns project data into polished internal updates in seconds
3. **Literacy** — A chatbot that answers employee questions about AI in plain, jargon-free English

This project was built to demonstrate practical AI tool integration in an enterprise context, with a focus on communication, documentation, and adoption — not just the technical side of AI.
